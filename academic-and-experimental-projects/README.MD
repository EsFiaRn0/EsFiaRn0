# 🎓 Academic & Experimental Projects

This repository serves as an index of my **academic and experimental work** in Computer Science.  
The projects listed here focus on **core theoretical concepts**, **practical implementations**, and **technical experimentation** developed throughout my studies and personal learning process.

These projects are primarily created for **learning and exploration purposes**.  
As such, some implementations may be exploratory in nature and may include incomplete features, unoptimized solutions, edge cases, or areas open to improvement.  
The main objective is to deepen conceptual understanding and document technical reasoning rather than to deliver production-ready software.

Rather than polished applications, the projects in this repository are intended to:
- Explore fundamental computer science concepts  
- Reinforce theoretical ideas through practical code implementations  
- Document learning outcomes and technical decision-making

## 🧠 Notes

- Each repository includes documentation describing:
  - the objective of the project  
  - the concepts involved  
  - the learning outcomes  
- Code quality reflects an **academic and experimental context**, not production constraints.
- This index evolves as new projects are added or refined.
